## Notes
- Different characters might need to be replaced, just ones that were ran into so far have been added.
- Depending on your AIML implementation the formatting of the map might need to be different.
- All nodes need to be in plain text format
- Should work for any versions of AIML, the keywords used and/or map format would just change.
- This is some 0.0.x version
