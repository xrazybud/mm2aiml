## Notes
- Different characters might need to be replaced, just ones that were ran into so far have been added.
- Depending on your AIML implementation the formatting of the map might need to be different.
- All nodes need to be in plain text format. (Ctrl+A then Alt-P finally F1, if you're not 100% sure)
- Should work for any versions of AIML, the keywords used and/or map format would just change.
- Will follow links to other mind maps - the paths must be set to absolute, or be relative to the binary. (Copy the file icon and paste as a hyperlink text field, or have your script cd into the same dir the root map is in, etc)
- This is some 0.0.x version.
